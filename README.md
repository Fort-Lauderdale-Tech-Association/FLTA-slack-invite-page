Automated Slack Invites
===================

It’s fair to say we love Slack. We started using it for our internal communications, but it didn’t take too long before we realized that we could use it as a community platform too.

Unfortunately, Slack doesn’t allow people to sign up directly. Instead, the Slack channel’s admin needs to invite them manually. Oy vey, right?

So we decided to create a fully automated Slack signup page for Fort Lauderdale's Tech community. We can simply point users to this page so they can enter their email address and receive an invite.

This process involved:

* integrated Slack API
* created and configured a webhook
* created and configured jobs/tasks
* used Stamplay web hosting
